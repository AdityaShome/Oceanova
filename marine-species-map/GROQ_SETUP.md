# Groq API Setup Instructions

## Issue Resolved ✅

The search suggestions are now working properly! The API was falling back to enhanced local suggestions because the Groq API key wasn't configured.

## What I Fixed

1. **Enhanced Fallback Suggestions**: Improved the local fallback to better handle scientific names and partial matches
2. **Better Search Logic**: Added intelligent matching for scientific name fragments (genus, species, partial names)
3. **Improved Groq Prompt**: Enhanced the AI prompt to better understand scientific names and partial queries
4. **Better Debugging**: Added more detailed logging to help troubleshoot issues

## Current Status

- ✅ Search suggestions work with scientific names (e.g., "Melanocetus", "johnsonii")
- ✅ Search suggestions work with common names (e.g., "angler", "vampire")
- ✅ Partial matches work (e.g., "Melanocetus" finds "Melanocetus johnsonii")
- ✅ Fallback system provides reliable suggestions when Groq API is unavailable

## To Enable Groq API (Optional)

If you want to use the Groq AI API for even better suggestions:

1. **Get a Groq API Key**:
   - Visit: https://console.groq.com/keys
   - Sign up for a free account
   - Create a new API key

2. **Create Environment File**:
   - Create a file named `.env.local` in the project root
   - Add your API key:
   ```
   GROQ_API_KEY=your_actual_api_key_here
   ```

3. **Restart the Development Server**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## Testing the Search

You can test the search functionality by:
- Typing scientific names: "Melanocetus", "Vampyroteuthis", "Riftia"
- Typing partial names: "johnsonii", "infernalis", "pachyptila"
- Typing common names: "angler", "vampire", "tube worm"

The search will now intelligently match your input with deep sea marine species!
